# the real noob's real quick guide to character building

## introduction

um, hi. this is pangya. it's a golf game. you know the deal. right? i hope so.  
so, you just got debug pangya. it's a good place, not greedy. you have those seemingly bottomless pockets to buy WHATEVER YOU WANT :D  
but there's so much to buy, where does one even start??

first things first, 10 million of each currency is indeed A LOT, so don't worry too much about frivolous buys.  
"pang" (P) is the in-game currency, while "points" (aka "cookies", C) are the supposedly real-money currency.

now well, what are some "close to optimal" builds?  
i won't optimize too much here, just the simple stuff you can do in 20 minutes as a clueless noob (so i won't mention stuff like memorial stuff, wind cards and Titan Cham here).

## basic stats

to answer the question of "what's optimal", let's go over the basic stats again:

* **power:** maximum distance, every point adds 2 yards.  
however, there's a catch - if it's too high, you start getting a penalty on your control and accuracy. it's not the worst thing ever, just something to keep in mind.
* **control:** determines how quickly the hit bar moves (higher control = slower). thus, higher control should make it easier to hit pangya.
* **accuracy:** this stat is actually literally useless as long as you hit pangya, so it can be actually zero for all i care. if you DO happen to miss pangya, higher accuracy means that the direction won't screw up as much.  
this has NOTHING to do with the size of the impact zone, that's a common misconception
* **spin:** determines how much spin you can put
* **curve:** determines how much curve you can put

and one non-basic one:

* **impact zone:** you can't really see this value anywhere, but this is actually THE most important stat.  
this determines the size of the little pangya white area, yeah that thing that makes you feel like a rhythm gamer and makes them yell "pangya!!" the higher this is, the easier it is to hit pangya, of course.

this is important, very VERY important: THE most important thing in this game is to hit pangya consistently.  
among the benefits of hitting pangya consistently are using special shots and backspins without fear, both of which are very powerful tools.  
what can we do to that end? first, we wanna max out our impact zone stat, and then balance our control and power to a point where we are comfortable. other stats are secondary.

## so, now what?

the character you choose doesn't really matter.  
as for clubset, since Control is the second most important stat in helping hitting pangya (after impact zone), i recommend any Control+7/Slot+12 one.

increasing impact zone:
* **(+1 pixel)** buy **Rainbow Fairy Wings** for your character, from Clothes > Accs.
* **(+2 pixel, random)** **Mascot: Wizzy, Wikky**. they increase your impact zone when they feel like it (i.e. randomly)
* **(+2 pixel)** this is luck-based and annoying, get **Cadie (SC)** card from Card Pack Vol.1 (buy in Item > Card Holic). equip in My Room > Char. Mastery and click Caddie slot

increasing control:
* **(+4 control)** **Clothes > Bottoms**, or **Tops that also include bottoms**: anything that adds up to 4 control (e.g. Control+1/Slot+3)
* **(+1 control, some characters)**: some characters also have Control+1 shoes, so check if yours does. that doesn't make their maximum control higher, they just kinda started with -1 control to begin with
* **(+4 control)** **Caddie: Papel, Cien (N), Mingti, Tiki**

as for the other stats, you can do whatever you want.
dress up however you like, and then actually do the slot upgrades:
* **character:** My Room > Char. Mastery
* **clubset:** My Room > Item > Club Sets > UP. don't bother with Club Workshop for now

that should be a good introduction. remember, the ultimate goal is to tend towards 100% pangya rate, the other things are secondary.  
have fun~ :3
