# the casual player's quick guide to unintuitive mechanics

## introduction

heya there~  
so you're having a good time, and consider yourself some kind of "intermediate" player.

you don't do tryhard calculations (just what is wrong with those people??), and you can hit at least -20 Pink Wind with great consistency.  
even -14 Silvia Cannon is not such a big deal, and you even feel a little adrenaline rush when it's some par 3 and the wind comes up 1m. very good.

this is NOT an "introduction to calculation", just a few FACTS that every player should know. perhaps some kind of complement to [tonycheese's guide](https://abacusarchives.wordpress.com/tonycheeses-guide/).  
it actually turns out that this game has quite a ton of "gotchas" and things that don't quite work as you'd expect.  
the intention here is to point out some useful facts and clear some of those most common misconceptions.


## terrain

this is a REALLY big gotcha. so, you know that from the rough it says "95%", rain is "98%", etc.  
what the hell do those percentages mean? i'm actually not too sure myself.  
however, to get to the point.. it's very intuitive to think that 95% just means that your power is cut by 5% (like, your max-power is 250y, so from the rough it'd be 237.5y). unfortunately, that's also totally wrong.

what is the truth of the matter, then? for some mysterious reason, terrains seem to effectively simply work as increments to distance.  
like, for tomahawks and backspins, if you are on the rough, you just play things out as being +4 to distance (e.g. hole is at 226y, if you're from the rough you just think of it as being 230y).  
that actually even stays consistent regardless of what your power is. so, it's the same thing if your power is 250y or 320y.  
that's all there is to it - it's actually the tryhard way of doing things!

here's a short tryhard table for how much distance to add for tomahawks and backspin shots in some common terrains.  
i know it's really weird, don't shoot the messenger:

terrain | tomahawk | backspin
------- | -------- | --------
95% | 4y | 4y
90% | 8y | 8y
85% | 12.5y | 12y
98% | 2y | 3.75y

i bet you thought there was a reasonable pattern coming up. this doesn't seem to make any sense? i agree.  
whatever works, though..


## tomahawk basics

the old tomahawk+backspin seems to be a bit unfashionable among the tryhard crowd nowadays.  
however, it'll always be simple, effective and low-risk, and should be the bread and butter of a good casual player.

first things first: just how does power work?  
it turns out that max power (up to something over 330y) goes a little bit beyond what's stated, and things just behave pretty weirdly in general.  
a pretty decent estimate is that, disregarding elevation and wind, 7 spin tomahawk max power is going to go about 4.5y beyond stated. so, say, 260y 100% tomahawk -> actually 264.5y.

so, what about lower %s? well, it only gets weirder from there.  
for starters, we'll just say that 90% power is approximately what's stated (but not quite), and 80% power will undershoot it (e.g. it might say 208y or whatever, but it's actually a little bit less than that).

so, i mentioned 7 spin. 7 spin is the best for tomahawks.  
why?? if it's higher, the spin might make it pop over the hole.  
if you've played long enough, surely you've seen it happen, or it might even have happened to yourself. it's really sad.

so, don't use higher than 7 spin for tomahawks.  
how to go about that? you can either just have 7 as your spin stat (i.e. maximum spin), or adjust by hand. i guess that deserves some more thorough explanation, but i'm not feeling it.


## heights

it's very natural to consider 1m = 1y. it's also pretty wrong.  
check out tonycheese's awesome mspaint diagram, in all its jpeg glory:

![tonycheese awesome mspaint powers diagram](/casual-mechanics/tonycheese-powers.jpg)

so, both your % power and the height itself influence how many y each m is worth. 5m elevation at 100% will be "worth less" than 5m elevation at 90%, and +10m elevation will be worth more than twice +5m elevation, while -10m elevation will be worth less than twice -5m elevation.  
heights are hard, but if you just want a simple number that's better than 1 to use everywhere, i'd say consider each 1m as 0.8y.  
if you want some actual numbers, check the actual tryhard guide (going to be made eventually).

also, that effect is less the lower the club. so, 5m elevation at 100% 1w will be "worth more" than 5m at 100% 3w, and worth MUCH more than 5m at 100% 8i.


## backspin basics

backspin is the other bread and butter shot for the good casual player.  
so, how far does a 100% power backspin reach?  
that will depend on your drive, but -16y is generally a pretty good estimate. so, if your power is 250y, a 100% backspin will reach about 234y, disregarding wind and elevation.  
something like -20y for 90%, and -24y for 80%.

optimal spin for backspins (i.e. won't pop the hole) is 9.


## wind basics

the main thing to remember here is that the more time the ball is up in the air, the more it will be influenced by wind. so:  
* **higher power**: more wind influence
* **negative elevation (e.g. -10m)**: more wind influence
* **positive elevation (e.g. +10m)**: less wind influence (obviously)
* **lower club**: more wind influence. effect of wind on 2w is stronger than on 1w, and 6i is WAY stronger than both

and a quick note on a common gotcha on angles.  
this is pure old trigonometry, but a 45-degrees wind angle is NOT equivalent to 0.5m wind - 45-degrees is more like 0.7, or something like that.  
from trigonometry we know that 30-degrees is actually 0.5, and 60-degrees is like 0.87. just something to have a feel for.


## wind and aim
it's hard to comment on wind, but when you're doing tomahawks up to like 270y or so (280y powershot) each 1m is worth less than 1y.  
backspin wind influences are considerably higher, worth more than 1y at 100% (except for really low drives).
on aim, i'd recommend trying out the powerbar method for your estimates. see part 3 of [tonycheese's guide](https://abacusarchives.wordpress.com/tonycheeses-guide/) for an introduction.  
when i'm being casual i just think like "ok 1m here is probably worth about 4 powerbars (guesstimate adjusted to conditions)" and just aim away.


that's all i can think of for now!  
have fun~ :3
