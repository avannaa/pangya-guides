# pangya-guides

just hosting a few of my guides for pangya. if you're a good player who has some suggestions, they're appreciated!

* [the real noob's real quick guide to character building](noob-building/noob-building.md)
* [the casual player's quick guide to unintuitive mechanics](/casual-mechanics/casual-mechanics.md)

coming SOON(?): high-quality, perfect-worthy calculation guides. [edit: they're [here](https://github.com/avannaa/illuminati-zone/)! and way better than these, curse of knowledge goes hard, apparently]  
want to understand the game? don't like excels that you don't understand? me neither.

if nothing else, you can find me on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/fate)
